        <h1>Sandwich</h1>
        
        <p>Now, a lot of you would say "Sandwich? Really?" but for those non believers I present thee the Sandwich<sup>TM</sup>.<br>You have not eaten a sandwich until you tried this one.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bread</strong><br>Chose that good bread, that breat that makes you remember another time when you ate bread this good.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong><br>You can't go wrong with the sliced cheese, pick a good brand that you like. My favorite is the one with <strong>turkey ham</strong>.</li>                
            <li><strong>Salami / Ham</strong><br>You can't go wrong with ham &#40; unless its really bad ham &#41;.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatos</strong><br>Some chose to slice them <strong><i>THICC</i></strong> but I prefer them thinly sliced as to not mess up the "feng shui" of the sandwich.</li>
            <li><strong>Cucumber</strong><br>I am a bit late on the cucumber hype train, but recently I started eating them even just sliced and with a bit of salt, magnificent snack.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation step by step</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice of bread comes first</li>
                <li>The rest of the ingredients</li>
                <li>Bread 2 &#40;optional&#41;</li>
                <li>There is no step 4 &#40;maybe toast it?&#41; enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
